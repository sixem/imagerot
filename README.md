![cover](https://github.com/sixem/imagerot/assets/2825338/9c1901d4-76e1-44d4-9053-aa3ac044acdc)

A lightweight, cross-environment image library for applying unique effects via raw image buffers.

Get started by reading the [API documentation](API.md).

Check out the [Web UI](https://five.sh/imagerot/) if you want to test out different effects or modes!

## Features
### Cross-Environment Consistency
* Achieves similar results in both Node and browser environments, ensuring good integration and usage across different environments.

### Configurable Build
* Allows for a custom build that only includes the desired effects or modes.

### Web Worker Support
* Compatible to be run within web workers in the browser, enabling improved performance.

### Lightweight Design
* Built with an emphasis on lightness, the package requires zero dependencies in the browser environment.

## Packaged Build
For use in the browser, the easiest way to get started is to use the pre-built source available in [dist](/dist/).

Include the script in your HTML `<head/>` tag:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="imagerot.min.js"></script>
```

## Package Manager
To use it in Node, install it using NPM:
```bash
npm install --save imagerot
```

Import the package:
```js
import imagerot from 'imagerot';
```

If you are targeting the browser, you can use:
```js
import imagerot from 'imagerot/browser';
```

## Example Usage
The basic usage is the same in Node as it is in the browser.

The general workflow consists of staging (preparing) an input, then modifying it by applying different modes or [effects](/EFFECTS.md):
```js
let staged = await imagerot.stage({
    // This can be a browser File, a pre-staged variable or even a Buffer returned from `fs`
    data: file
    // URLs are supported too:
    //url: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Shaqi_jrvej.jpg'
});
```
To modify the staged variable:
```js
// Apply the `chimera` effect to the image
staged = await imagerot.useMode(staged, 'chimera');
// Apply a `pixelate` effect to the image
staged = await imagerot.useEffect(staged, 'pixelate', { intensity: 50 });
```
The project exports some environment-specific variables for both browser and Node, but in this example we'll only cover the basic ones.

For a more detailed overview of the available functions, refer to the [API documentation](API.md).

To display the modified image in the Browser, one can use `bufferToBlob()`:
```js
const img = document.querySelector('img.output');
// Convert the buffer to a Blob URL and display it
img.setAttribute('src', await imagerot.bufferToBlob(staged));
```

Or, to save the modified image in Node, you can use `saveBuffer()`
```js
const output = `${Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)}.png`;
await imagerot.saveBuffer(staged, output);
```

## Building
You can build the project from source yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sixem/imagerot/
cd imagerot
npm install
npm run build
```
This will create both a `lib` for Node-usage and a `dist` with the packaged browser-compatible files.

You can also adjust the exported effects and modes before building, if you want to create a customized bundle.

### Targeted Builds:
* **Browser:** `npm run build:webpack`
* **Node:** `npm run build:ts`

## Disclaimer
This project has taken a lot of inspiration from [datamosh](https://github.com/Datamosh-js/datamosh), which is a similar project, so big thanks to the creator of that! 💖

ImageRot was created to provide a way to easily manipulate buffers in the browser. It puts a big focus on general effects, image editing, and the combination of effects and modes to create unique results! :sparkles:
